    "Transfer Learning with TensorFlow\n",
    "Transfer learning is the practice of starting with a network that has already been trained, and then applying that network to your own problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because neural networks can often take days or even weeks to train, transfer learning (i.e. starting with a network that somebody else has already spent a lot of time training) can greatly shorten training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how we do go about applying transfer learning? Two popular methods are feature extraction and finetuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction. We take a pretrained neural network and replace the final layer (classification layer) with a new classification layer for the new dataset or perhaps even a small neural network (eventually has a classification layer). During training the weights in all the old layers are frozen, only the weights for the new layer we added are trained. In other words, the gradient doesn't flow backwards past the first new layer we add.\n",
    "Finetuning. Essentially the same as feature extraction except the weights of the old model aren't frozen. The network is trained end-to-end.\n",
    "In this lab and the one later in the section we're going to focus on feature extraction since it's less computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that AlexNet was trained on the ImageNet database, which has 1000 classes of images. You can see the classes in the caffe_classes.py file. None of those classes involves traffic signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to successfully classify our traffic sign images, you need to remove the final, 1000-neuron classification layer and replace it with a new, 43-neuron classification layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called feature extraction, because you're basically extracting the images features captured by the penultimate layer, and passing them to a new classification layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "First, I figure out the shape of the final fully connected layer, in my opinion this is the trickiest part. To do that I have to figure out the size of the output from fc7. Since it's a fully connected layer I know it's shape will be 2D so the second (or last) element of the list will be the size of the output. fc7.get_shape().as_list()[-1] does the trick. I then combine this with the number of classes for the Traffic Sign dataset to get the shape of the final fully connected layer, shape = (fc7.get_shape().as_list()[-1], nb_classes). The rest of the code is just the standard way to define a fully connected in TensorFlow. Finally, I calculate the probabilities via softmax, probs = tf.nn.softmax(logits)."
